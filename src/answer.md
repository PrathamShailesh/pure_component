Which out of the two components (which are performing the same functionality) is performing better and how?

PureComponent performs better because it compares the current and next state and props, and it skips the rendering process if there are no changes, thus avoiding unnecessary re-renders. also they are particularly useful when dealing with complex state and props, as they can help prevent unnecessary renders and improve performance.
